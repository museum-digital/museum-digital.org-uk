## The Main Frontend of museum-digital

museum-digital was founded to publish museum object information online. That's not possible without the right software.

The "frontend" is thus the first application, that was developed at museum-digital. With it, museums can join together to present themselves and their objects online.

To offer a comprehensive glimpse at the museums and their objects, a variety of additional information has been made presentable since. On the one hand, museums can now add information on their collections, object groups, exhibitions, and events. On the other, a number of options for linking and visualizing information have been added.

### Technical Information

#### Focus - Design Principles

"The "frontend" of museum-digital is primarily designed to always offer a clear focus on whichever information is central to a given page or section. This allows for easy understanding. A lot of additional options exist for power users - from visualizations to a command line menu embedded into the website. These are however "hidden" in sidebars or only accessible through keyboard shortcuts, so that they don't irritate first-time users.

#### API(s)

Publishing and making things accessible doesn't only mean making it possible to view something. It also means enabling people to use data to realize their own ideas. Accordingly, all information that is published using the "frontend" of museum-digital is also accessible in a machine-readable way via our JSON API.

As much as possible, the "frontend" provides information in open standards as well: object information can be accessed in [LIDO](http://www.lido-schema.org/), information about museums can be downloaded as electronic business cards ([vCard](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard)), and calendar information such as exhibitions can be integrated with calendar tools using the [iCalendar](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar) standard.

{{ highlighted_tile_section(headline = "Open Standards", tiles = [
    [
        'LIDO',
        'for object metadata',
        "Based on [CIDOC-CRM](https://www.cidoc-crm.org/), LIDO offers a standardized XML format for exchanging object metadata for museums. Many of the central concepts museum-digital is built on originate from LIDO (such as the event structure for more precisely describing location and dating).",

As IIIF requires server-side editing of the images before they are sent to the user, it is only available for locally hosted images. For these however, IIIF version 2.1 is fully implemented.',

#### Development

The "frontend" of museum-digital is built using PHP8 and MySQL. JavaScript is used for interactive features and visualizations. A list of the used libraries can be found here. We use git for version control.

----

{% counter_section_left(api = "md_frontend_system", name = "languages") %}
The frontend is build for multi-lingual use and has been translated to a number of languages. Of course, we are always looking forward to help in translating the frontend (just like all other tools at museum-digital) to new languages. A description of how our dedicated translation tool can be used for doing so is [available on the blog (German)](https://blog.museum-digital.org/de/2019/03/02/museum-digital-uebersetzen/).
{% end %}

----

{% counter_section_right_plain_number(api = "md_global_stats", selector = "museums", name = "institutions") %}
Many museums come together to use museum-digital as a publication platform - and thus come to present their objects using the frontend.
