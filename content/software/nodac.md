## Nodac: Manage Controlled Vocabularies

nodac is museum-digital's tool for curating controlled vocabularies. That means labeling, describing, translating, creating hierarchies of concepts and linking concepts to the corresponding entries in external repositories like Wikidata, GND, AAT, geonames, etc.

As the primary management tool behind museum-digital's vocabularies it is essential for nodac to be trainable. In nodac, one can blacklist terms altogetherr, set up the automatic transfer of terms from one vocabulary to another and store permanent rewrites of terms to their canonical forms. It is thus build to not only facilitate a precise editing process, but also a sustainable one despite limited resources.

nodac is able to work with multiple polyhierarchical thesauri and follows the SKOS 2 standard.

### Linked open data

From the start, nodac has been written with linked open data in mind. It not only helps curating such links but also enables the automatic retrieval of data recorded at Wikidata, the Gemeinsame Normdatei (GND).
